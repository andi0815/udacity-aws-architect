In case the database does not run in the affected AZ, RTO and RPO are zero.

In case the AZ of the primary DB is affected, them minimum RTO for a single 
AZ outage could be very low, if the problem is detected by Amazon, directly. 
Amazon says "typically 60â€“120 seconds" in case of an infrastructure defect (see: 
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Concepts.MultiAZSingleStandby.html).

In case the whole region of the primary database is affected, the minimum RTO to 
switch over to the replicated database will be similar, but the new URL will have to be
promoted to the productive Applications as well. 
If this process is automized, it still depends on the complexity of the application. 
This can easily add some more minutes.
    
The minimum RPO should be the same for an AZ outage and a Region outage, because the RPO ends,
when the primary DB does not accept new data anymore. This RPO time could be very low, if the 
problem is detected aurtomatically (by Amazon). In this case it should be in the magnitude of
seconds (<1min).
